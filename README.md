# Super Bowl Ads

This is my Data+Files research project on Super Bowl Ads.

## Introduction
My initial interest to this data set on Super Bowl Ads came from my interest in football. However, I love marketing and this data set seemed like a perfect combination. The Super Bowl has been used by advertisers for a while as a way to generate awareness for their products and services by taking advantage of the wide audience this event reaches. Also, super bowl ads in themselves are often a topic of discussion which means additionally exposure if ads are reposted or compiled into a potentially viral video. I thought this data set was interesting because it examined the different characteristics within ads from within a twenty year range. In America, the Super Bowl sometimes seems like a holiday. My first question I attempted to answer was "Are the majority of the ads patriotic?" Secondly, out of curiosity, I asked "Are more ads funny from 2000-2010 or from 2010-2020?" I thought it would be interesting to see, if advertisers have chosen to implement humor into their ads more recently or began to steer away from it.
